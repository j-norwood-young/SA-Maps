Schools
-------

School data includes all the schools in South Africa according to the Dept of Education (data for 2012 and 2013), plus education districts. Please note that education districts don't seem to be 100% accurate, especially in North West, and there are no school district names provided by the Department of Basic Education for Mpumalanga. Weird.

Command we used for making CSV smaller (2012 data): 
```cut -d, -f 1,5-6,11,25-26,31,33,35,37,39,48-65,100-101 input.csv > output.csv```

Command we used for making CSV smaller (2013 data): 
```cut -d, -f 1,4-5,10,13,15,29-30,40,42,44,45-46,50,58-75,116-118 National_Schools_Q1_2013.original.csv > National_Schools_Q1_2013.csv```

Command we used for changing ``GIS_Lat`` and ``GIS_Long`` to ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` (2012 data only): 
```sed 's/GIS_Lat/latitude/' input.csv | sed 's/GIS_Long/longitude/' > output.csv```
